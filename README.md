# Data Visualization - Sales Dashboard

This project is a simple sales dashboard built with HTML and Chart.js.

It displays:

- A bar chart of sales per month.
- A pie chart showing percentage distribution of sales.

The data is loaded dynamically from the `sales-data.json` file.

This demo project can be extended to visualize any time-series or categorical data.
